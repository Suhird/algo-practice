LeetCode Problem:-  Find Duplicates in an array of numbers

Given an array of integers, 1<=a[i]<=n(n=size of array), some elements appear twice
and others appear once

Find all elements that appear twice in this array

Could you do it in without extra space and in O(n) runtime

Example
input = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

output = [2,3]

'''
def find_duplicate(arr):
    pass
    



if __name__=='__main__':

    input_arr = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
    output_arr = find_duplicate(input_arr)
